<h1>Surizo</h1>
<p>Chorizo is a highly seasoned chopped or ground pork sausage used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. Mexican chorizo is made with fresh (raw, uncooked) pork, while the Spanish version is usually smoked.</p>

<p> Mexican chorizo is typically seasoned with vinegar and chile peppers, while Spanish chorizo is made with garlic and pimentón (Spanish smoked paprika, either sweet or hot), which gives it its deep brick-red color and smoky flavor. (Authentic Spanish, deeply smoky and tangy chorizo is a revelation—but there's also nothing like a spicy, beautifully greasy-in-the-best-way chorizo taco.)</p>
